<p>On January 5th, 2012, the American Economics Association adopted <a href="http://www.aeaweb.org/PDF_files/PR/AEA_Adopts_Extensions_to_Principles_for_Author_Disclosure_01-05-12.pdf">new guidelines</a> for the disclosure of potential conflicts of interests by economists.&nbsp; I am very supportive of this initiative. Please find my disclosure information below.</p>

<p><strong>In-kind and financial contributions to teaching activities and student clubs</strong></p>



<p>I receive wonderful support from government, industry, and NGOs for my teaching activity. I have had, over my time at University of Alberta, representatives the Alberta Ministries of Environment, Energy, and Finance and Enterprise, many major oil, gas, energy services, pipeline and electricity companies, Epcor, the Pembina Institute, and many others speak in my classes.&nbsp; I have never offered compensation beyond accommodation and travel expenses for speakers, either directly or in-kind, with the exception of a small token of appreciation from the class. While I have not been invited to do so often, I would feel obliged to return the favour of speaking at the request of someone who has taken time to speak in my class.</p>



<p>Student clubs with which associated have received significant support from both government and industry. In particular, the annual Alberta Energy Challenge business competition would not have been possible, without these generous support of Suncor and Cenovus who provided financial and in-kind resources for competition from 2010 through 2018.</p>



<p><strong>Family conflicts of interest</strong></p>



<p>To the best of my knowledge, no members of my immediate family have personal or financial relationships which would be viewed by reasonable individual to constitute conflict of interest with either my research or public commentary. My sister-in-law, Susan Holt, is the Leader of His Majesty&#8217;s Loyal Opposition in New Brunswick, which I will disclose when relevant.</p>



<p><strong>Asset disclosure</strong></p>



<p>I currently hold shares in Shopify, Enbridge, RBC, and CIBC as well as others held in Canadian index ETFs and mutual funds. My spouse holds a diversified portfolio. We hold no stocks in companies that would be materially affected by my research or public commentary.</p>



<p><strong>Political Activity</strong></p>



<p>I am not, nor have I ever been, a member of a provincial or federal party. I have, occasionally, provided free advice to elected officials and staff from all major parties both in Alberta and across the country. I have made no political donations that I can recall (I&#8217;ll hedge in case I attended an event which served as a political fundraiser at some point during my university career), and certainly none in the past 10 years. My spouse is not a member of any federal or provincial political party, although she has donated to her sister&#8217;s campaigns in New Brunswick. I was appointed by Ministerial Reference to Chair the Climate Change Leadership Panel in Alberta by Minister Shannon Phillips, but I was a bureaucratic employee not political staff.</p>
