excerpt: "Climate change is the environmental, political and societal challenge of our time. But we, as Canadians, have not always responded with our best efforts or grandest ideas.

Too often, our discussions of climate change rely on half-truths, easy sound bites and other ways to avoid difficult conversations. Some of these cut against action on climate change: We tell ourselves that Canada’s a cold country, so climate change won’t affect us, or that we account for only 2 per cent of global emissions, so anything we do will not matter. We tell ourselves that the world will still use oil and gas, and perhaps even more of it in the future than today. But one of these sound bites instead gives comfort to those pushing for much more stringent policies here in Canada: the assurance that governments can provide a “just transition” away from fossil fuels, with nobody left behind."
