excerpt: "Saskatchewan, in trying to defy the federal carbon tax, has come up with a bold set of legal machinations. Bold, that is, in the way a child jumping their checker diagonally across the board in one giant leap and yelling “King me!” is bold. The federal government should have just ignored it. But on Wednesday Ottawa confirmed it would go along with the province’s fantasy role-playing game. It’s mind-boggling."
