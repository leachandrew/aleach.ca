I think I was destined to be an economist from the time I took John Livernois' class at Guelph, although I fought this particular destiny for years before I gave in. I remember John asking us questions like, "if the Premier asked for your advice..." and "if you had to advise the manager of a company on how to reduce their emissions, given this information, what would you suggest?" Simple, yes, and contrived, but they put the goal in my head. That's what economics was. At least to me.

Most every paper we write, from the most arcane theory or niche statistical test all the way to economy-wide studies, ends with policy implications. Policy is what economists do. And it's what I've done. And, I've had a chance to do some pretty cool things.

From the outside, you probably think I've been successful. I've advised Premiers and Prime Ministers and the CEOs of Canada's largest companies. I've spoken to Cabinets, to House and Senate Committees, to international conferences and to corporate boards. I've written countless articles appearing in all the publications that have sat on my coffee table: Maclean's, the Globe and Mail, and the local papers too - the Journal and the Citizen - and I was even quoted once in the Telegraph Journal for my grandmother to read. And, I've published some good papers in academic journals that few people read too. I've earned 4 degrees. People generally seem to think I know what I'm talking about. I guess that's good.

But, where I sit, the picture's not as nice. I wish it were. And lately, it's felt like it's too much to handle. It's felt like a trap, because to admit what's happening is to admit that what you think about me isn't true.

Maybe I'll find my way out of this. Maybe I won't. If I don't, there's one place and one place only on which the blame should fall: the Alberta School of Business. If, one day, I'm not here, they'll be the reason why. And, if you valued what I did while I was here, don't let them live it down. And, don't send them your kids or your money.
