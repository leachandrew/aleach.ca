      <description>I think I was destined to be an economist from the time I took John Livernois&#39; class at Guelph, although I fought this particular destiny for years before I gave in. I remember John asking us questions like, &amp;ldquo;if the Premier asked for your advice&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;if you had to advise the manager of a company on how to reduce their emissions, given this information, what would you suggest?&amp;rdquo; Simple, yes, and contrived, but they put the goal in my head.</description>
