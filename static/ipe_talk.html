# The world needs oil


&gt; (...) most economists expect that we're going to continue to be growing the use of oil and gas at least over the next one to two decades. 

.cite_quote[Alex Pourbaix, Cenovus CEO, [*The Current*](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/monday-march-6-2023-episode-transcript-1.6770155), Monday March 6, 2023]


&gt; We’re still going to need combustion engines.  We’re going to still need oil for the next 10 to 15 years because all of the sudden, they’re not all going to go away. 

.cite_quote[[President Joe Biden](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/03/09/remarks-by-president-biden-on-his-budget-for-fiscal-year-2024/), March 9, 2023]


&gt; There is a global demand for Canadian oil and natural gas, and this country will be producing both for years to come. (...) [F]orcing an artificial cut in production of Canadian oil and gas, when global demand exists, is not the way to (reduce Canada's emissions). The void would be filled by OPEC, Moscow and others. It would leave us poorer and weaker, and would benefit neither us nor our allies.

# ... and gas


&gt; Do we want to contribute to international security and global emissions reductions by further developing our gas reserves? Or does the world’s 5th-largest producer and 6th-largest exporter of natural gas prefer to keep its energy battalions off the field?

.cite_quote[Edward Greenspon, Kim Henderson, Dave Nikolejsin, [Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-canada-hydrogen-natural-gas-export/), Monday March 6, 2023]


&gt; Oil and gas is going to remain a part of our energy mix for years to come. We know that even the boldest projections for clean energy deployment suggest that in the middle of the century we are going to be using abated fossil fuels." 

.cite_quote[Jennifer Granholm, US Secretary of Energy, at CERA week (via [Javier Blas](https://twitter.com/JavierBlas/status/1633614736225976323)), March 8, 2023]


&gt; “When I’m prime minister, I will repeal C-69, the anti-energy law. I’ll clear the way for our mines, our resources and our natural gas export terminals. We will liquefy natural gas in Canada. We will ship it to Asia to shut down dirty coal fired plants and replace them with clean Canadian gas.”

# The world needs oil


Each of these statements contain common elements:
- the world will continue to use oil and gas into the foreseeable future;
- technological change might be fast, but adoption is slow;
- acknowledging climate change but not the impact of climate policies on energy markets;
- a sense we should prefer domestic production to production in other locations.

But, each is often *heard* to be saying something subtly different
- the world will continue to use *more* oil and/or gas year-over-year;
- technological change won't disrupt the demand and/or the price of oil or gas;
- [insert Canadian energy source here] has lower emissions per unit than plausible alternatives;
- the market will be willing to pay a premium for Canadian oil (or gas).

Each set of bullets suggests a different future for Canadian oil and gas
---

# Canadian oil's comparative challenge(s) and advantage(s)

Relative to other sources of global oil, new Canadian oil (oil sands) barrels:
- are relatively emissions-intensive
- produce mostly heavy, *sour* crude which trades at a discount
- are located *far*, both geographically and infrastructure-wise, from growing markets
- have long investment cycles with high up-front costs

But, existing oil (and oil sands) production is very low cost:
- some *in situ* oil sands projects have operating costs below $10 per barrel
- royalty and tax regimes provide substantial risk hedging
- current carbon pricing regimes largely preserve industry competitiveness
- Canadian and Albertan governments appear poised to offer substantial support for CCUS projects

---

# Canadian LNG's comparative challenge(s) and advantage(s)

Relative to other sources of global LNG, new Canadian LNG:
- has multiple mountain ranges between it and the coast;
- must compete with facilities anywhere in North America;
- has plant locations in relatively remote, small communities;
- faces stringent domestic (BC and Ottawa) regulations.

But, Canadian LNG does have some potential advantages too:
- shorter route to Asia;
- domestic, potentially stranded gas;
- lower temperature delta required due to northern locations;
- access to clean hydroelectricity.

# How does the world use oil? Mostly to move people and freight


.pull-left[
- it's a common soundbite to remind people that oil is used for more than just transportation fuels

- products like electronics, household goods, etc. use oil

- you're meant to imagine that this is a large share of global oil demand. 

- Petrochemicals are not a major source of oil demand. About 1/5th of oil demand today goes into chemicals.

# Transportation demand drops with action on climate change
.pull-left[
- global action on climate change drives reduction in passenger and freight use of oil

- fastest declines are in passenger vehicles

- petrochemical uses of oil are more resilient to action on climate change

# Oil take-aways

- an expanding global market for oil is inconsistent with action on climate change

- insofar as economists are predicting the expansion of oil consumption, they are assuming exacerbated climate change (which might be the right assumption)

- existing Canadian oil assets are well-positioned to continue existing (and even expanded) production

- royalty regime does provide some protection (more on this in a bit)

- new production, and the booming labour markets that come with it, are likely a thing of the past


---



# What about gas?

- gas is, in many ways, more interesting than oil in the context of a climate-constrained world

- gas provides (as we have seen in Alberta) an alternative to coal

- gas also locks-in dependence on fossil fuels

- we'll see how there is more variability in gas projections, but similar central narratives to those discussed re: oil

# Domestic Emissions

- what about the domestic situation? How does oil and gas fit in Canada's domestic emissions commitments?

- Canada's emissions commitments are only compatible with oil and gas expansion if expansion is coupled with CCUS

- CCUS exacerbates some of the existing issues facing the sector and, depending on Canadian governments' resolve, may need to be mostly paid for by governments not oil corporations

  ![:scale 90%](roof_1.png)
- as preserving your investment in an existing asset
  
  ]

.pull-right[
&lt;hr.space&gt;

- if we think of CCUS as existential for the oil sands (ditto electric drive for LNG) in Canada, then you have to look at the rate of return as a function of the project as a whole

- the CCUS investment creates the conditions under which you can still earn returns from the existing project

---

# CCUS: Fixing your roof, or **buying a hobby farm**?

.pull-left[
&lt;hr.space&gt;
- thought of in a vacuum, CCUS must compete with other bespoke investment opportunities

- CCUS must earn a rate of return, and shareholders will be unwilling to bet on carbon credit values over time

- this means it will only happen if it's subsidized/under-written by governments

# CCUS: Fixing your roof, or **buying a hobby farm**?

Industry has, to date, framed it as Canada's job to fix industry's roof:
&lt;br&gt;
&gt; What is in it for the Canadian public for (doing that)investing billions in CCUS for the oil sands)? And I think right off the bat, you have to look at the contribution of this industry. This year in 2023 will probably represent something in the range of about 10% of Canada's GDP. And according to Revenue Canada, we employ directly or indirectly the better part of 450,000 Canadians. This year alone, we're going to pay $50 billion in royalties and taxes. I think our industry represents something like 13% of the Canadian government's tax revenues. So there is a huge benefit from this industry continuing.

# Conclusions

- Global energy markets are sending conflicting signals to Canada
  - Desire for energy security
  - Desire for emissions reductions
  
- A bet on increasing fossil fuel consumption is a bet against action on climate change

- The surest cure for low prices is...everyone betting on low prices

- I can't tell you what the right answer is, only what I hope will happen
  - Global producers *bet* on action on climate change, leaving a lucrative market for Canadian production
  - Canadian producers limit investments in new, long-lived projects and regulators ensure downside protection
  - Regulators ensure environmental cleanup is prioritized and bonded
